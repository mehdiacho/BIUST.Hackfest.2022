# BIUST.Hackfest.2022
Developed a mobile app for the BIUST Open golf tournament using Android Studio and Java. Worked with a team to create a platform for the BIUST Resource Mobilization Committee initiative.


The BIUST Open Mobile Golf App was developed as part of the BIUST Hackfest 2022, a hackathon aimed at creating platforms for the BIUST Resource Mobilization Committee initiatives. The goal of the hackathon was to develop a mobile or web app for the university's golf tournament, the "BIUST Open". Our team chose to develop an android mobile app using Android Studio and Java programming language.

The app serves as an all-in-one platform for players and organizers of the BIUST Open golf tournament. For players, the app allows for easy registration and participation in the tournament. The app also provides players with important information such as tournament schedules, leaderboards, and updates from the organizers.

For organizers, the app provides a centralized platform to manage the tournament, including player registration and tracking, tournament scheduling, and tournament updates. The app also allows organizers to easily communicate with players and keep them informed throughout the tournament.

The BIUST Open Mobile Golf App was developed with user-friendliness and ease of use in mind. Its clean and intuitive interface makes it easy for both players and organizers to navigate and use the app. Whether you are a seasoned golfer or a new player, this app will help make your tournament experience seamless and enjoyable.
